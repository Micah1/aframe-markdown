# Labradors

Labradors are medium-large, with males typically weighing 65-80 lb (29-36 kg) and females 55-70 lb (25-32 kg).
The majority of the characteristics of this breed, with the exception of colour, are the result of breeding to 
produce a working retriever.

As with some other breeds, the Conformation (typically "Show", "English" or "bench") and 
the Field (typically "Working" or "American") lines differ, although both lines are bred in both countries.
In general, however, Conformation Labradors tend to be bred as medium-sized dogs, shorter and stockier with 
fuller faces and a slightly calmer nature than their Field counterparts, which are often bred as taller, 
lighter-framed dogs, with slightly less broad faces and a slightly longer nose.
